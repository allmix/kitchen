Ikeas door thicknesses are thinner than howdens. However, they also supply made to measure cabinet doors for bespoke kitchens , houseboats and other unconventional spaces. I would never quote to supply and fit anything other. Comparative price to ikea, but twice the quality.

<p>You see, we didn�t actually go for a b&amp;q kitchen in the end. German kitchens are designed to sneak storage space into areas you may never even have thought of, giving us the flexibility to put together a kitchen that offers way more than the sum of its parts.

<p>We installed a b&amp;q cooke and lewis high gloss cream kitchen in our old house and really loved it, id probably go with the same again in this house when the time comes. I�m more asking about how the kitchens actually stack up quality wise, after sales service, guarantees and are they honoured or do you have to argue with them. Have looked at b&amp;q kitchens but not that impressed with the quality, but have a limited budget as we are renovating a whole house. This is b&amp;q mussel Brookfield kitchen. VH. Swipe for.</p>

<p>We once lived in a house with an older b&amp;q kitchen where the decorative film came off the bridging unit above the hob. We almost bought a howdens kitchen, but realised that you only buy the planning and units. The kitchen fitter i�m using also uses howdens, so i�ve looked on their website and am impressed, and also the rental property we are in at the moment has a basic howdens kitchen and the units are good quality compared to b&amp;q. bq kitchens Google Search Kitchen design, Howdens.</p>

<p>The problem with both b&amp;q kitchens was appalling service. But on the other hand, reading up the specifications it sounded like the current b&amp;q carcasses have stronger back panels. Cant comment on the fitting because my husband fitted the whole lot himself but we had no problems with b&amp;q during the buying process or whilst paying the kitchen off over 4yrs.

<p>Howdens are l brackets and only cleats for the top units. Trying to decide what is going to be more value for money out of wren and howdens, used wren ages ago when budget was £3k and wasn’t overly impressed with service but i hear they are much better now days. Just a heads up howdens are trade only and their prices are better than b&amp;q etc for kitchen units etc. Matt Cream Shaker Kitchen Unit Cupboard Doors fits Howdens.</p>
<h3 id="ikea-kitchens-howdens-and-bampq-were-on-our-hit-list">Ikea Kitchens, Howdens And B&amp;Q Were On Our Hit List.</h3><p>It’s seems ok but i definitely think diy kitchen unit and doors are better. Have looked at b&amp;q kitchens but not that impressed with the quality, but have a limited budget as we are renovating a whole house. You can find your local howdens and once your builder has booked a design appointment for you, you will be able to visit your nearest howdens to view your kitchen design. We ended up going with diy kitchens also.</p>
<h3 id="kitchen-fitter-was-impressed-amp-reckoned-quality-was-better-than-howdens">Kitchen Fitter Was Impressed &amp; Reckoned Quality Was Better Than Howdens.</h3><p>Ideally i would see a range of assembled howdens units to get a sense for their stability. However, they also supply made to measure cabinet doors for bespoke kitchens , houseboats and other unconventional spaces. Our howden’s units are ok, for the money, but the appliances they supplied are terrible, they’ve all broken within 4 years.

But on the other hand, reading up the specifications it sounded like the current b&amp;q carcasses have stronger back panels. You have to find your own fitter and they do not recommend one.</p>
<h3 id="theyve-had-it-in-a-few-years-and-the-door-edges-are-starting-to-peel">They’ve Had It In A Few Years And The Door Edges Are Starting To Peel.</h3><p>B&amp;q kitchens are the worst company that i have ever had the misfortune to come across! Howdens do too but less options. I�m more asking about how the kitchens actually stack up quality wise, after sales service, guarantees and are they honoured or do you have to argue with them. With howdens you can usually ger replacements straight away.</p>
