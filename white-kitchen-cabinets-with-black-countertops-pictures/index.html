Black and White Kitchen Ideas for Quartz Countertops From countertopsnews.com

Yet another alternative is usually to set white and black tiles on the floor or maybe black and white backsplash, and also, in case you do not insist on stainless steel, you can definitely have kitchens with black appliances. The countertops are glossy black quartz.
