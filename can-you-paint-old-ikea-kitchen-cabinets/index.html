My finished kitchen makeover. Cast in style cup handles From pinterest.pt
We’ve been asked all sorts of questions from customers wanting to use our shaker doors to replace their old ikea doors while still using their old ikea cupboards / cabinets. For example, a kitchen that would typically cost $25,000 in custom cabinetry can end up being about $6,000 if you had shopped at ikea. Instead, you can replace the cabinet doors, drawer fronts, pull, doorknobs, and hinges. So we have decided to give the kitchen a facelift by painting the cupboards dark blue.
