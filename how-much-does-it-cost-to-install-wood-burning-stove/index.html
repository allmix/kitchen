Cost of Installing a WoodBurning Stove From priceyourjob.co.uk
According to current industry estimates, the cost of installing a wood stove can be anywhere from $1,000 to $4,000. According to checkatrade, the average cost to install a log burner is around £2,000 and that’s on top of the stove itself, which will set you back around £950. When you’re considering the cost of installing a wood stove in the basement, you need to keep in mind both the price of the wood stove as well as the cost of installing a ventilation system. Of course, as with anything, you can always spend more on certain elements to improve aesthetics or provide a specific finish.
