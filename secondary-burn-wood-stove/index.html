<meta name="description" content="Simple Secondary Burn Wood Stove With Cheap Cost, Secondary or catalytic combustion systems for wood stoves are able to utilize the unburned gases from the primary fire to create additional heat and decrease pollutants. Secondary burn is a feature incorporated in the majority of new wood burning stoves.
&#34;DEFRA APPROVED&#34; A&#43; Cream Enamel Coseyfire Petit Multi From stoveworlduk.co.uk
The secondary air allowed the stove to burn a little hotter, cleaned up the exhaust gasses a lot, and reduced our wood use by about 11% (when i compared 2 back to back years and compensated for differences in heating degree days between the 2). Secondary combustion happens above the wood, burning the gases the wood gives off. Tertiary combustion takes place in the catalyst. At the top, there is a primary and secondary burner.
